a) What ? Why? How?
1) Title changed from "Website to "Horiseon-Homepage". because it is a better and more specific name. 
2) The first photo was too big. Made the main photo smaller and added margin to the bottom so that people will see some content with the first glance at the first page without scrolling down so much.
3) Delete Div around header and changed it to just header. Also, making the sematic html properties to more specific ones such as section and aside will help the code to be read easier.
4) img is self closing so no need for / just > is enough. Just to clean up the code.
5) Search-Engine-Optimization only had a class and that is why I added an ID.
6) cleaned the alignment of the code such as the way opening and closing commands are sorted
7) changed semantic html properties to more specific ones such as section and aside
8) gave class names to two groups of three, and made the .css file a bit shortened by soing so, (naming them by class name)
9) font change to the title of each box on the left so they appear on the same line.

f) Areas of improvement?
This html file can definitely improve by working on its arrangements. The CSS file can still be shortened. One problem with this website is that the contents get out of order when you shrink the page which can be fixed once I learn more during this class.
